Looking at flappy bird, I was amazed purely by the simplicity of the game.I kept thinking how simple it must have been to create, and so with no prior knowledge of game develoopment and a very very limited knowledge of java - I gave it a try. 

#####   Some 5 000 lines of code and what must be a few months later, I now have Crator.

Crator is designed using LibGDX. It is recomended to create a new project using LibGDX tool (Android and Desktop)
  and then copy the Git files into the project folder replacing all files as you do so.
  If you have any trouble, get in touch with the creator, Dimcon (Daimon Sewell).
  
  As with usual LibGDX projects, the main game code is in the Core directory --> core/src/com/UpYoursgdx/Crator/GameView.java
  Also as with LibGDX projects the resources and graphics --> android/assets
